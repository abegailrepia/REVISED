\section{Background of the Problem}

The efficient flow of people within educational institutions, particularly in dynamic environments like colleges, schools, and programs (CSP), is crucial for maintaining operational effectiveness and enhancing the student  experience. Bottlenecks, long waiting times, and inefficient processes could lead to frustration, decreased productivity, and ultimately impact student satisfaction and academic success. Optimizing these flow-of-people patterns requires a comprehensive understanding of the underlying processes and the ability to test and evaluate potential improvements. Simulation modeling offers a powerful approach to analyze and optimize these complex systems and allowed administrators to make data-driven decisions regarding resource allocation, process redesign, and infrastructure improvements. Two prominent simulation techniques, Discrete-Event Simulation (DES) and Continuous Simulation (CS), offered distinct advantages and disadvantages in modeling student flow within a CSPC, particularly within critical service areas such as the Registrar’s Office, which was a pivotal point in the school \cite{jamil2023optimizing}.

Discrete-Event Simulation (DES) models systems as a sequence of events occurring at discrete points in time. This approach was particularly well-suited for modeling systems with 2 distinct entities (e.g., students) that moved through a series of processes (e.g., registration, payment, document submission). DE simulation excels at capturing the variability and stochasticity inherent in many real-world systems, such as variable arrival rates, service times, and resource availability \cite{do2022metamodel}. This level of granularity could provide valuable insights into the impact of queues, resource utilization, and staffing level on student flow. In contrast, Continuous Simulation (CS)  models systems using differential equations that described the continuous changes in state variables over time. While less common in modeling individual student behavior, CS could have been useful for representing aggregate flow and systemic trends, such as the overall density of students in a particular area or the rate at which students completed a specific process. The choice between DES and CS depended heavily on the specific objectives of the simulation study and the level of detail required to address the researched questions. This study focuses on a CSPC, highlighting the need for targeted strategies to alleviate congestion and improve student service outcomes \cite{DigitalTwin2025}.

The Registrar’s Office handles functions from enrollment to graduation and represents a key area where optimized student flow could significantly impact efficiency and satisfaction. The general goal of this research is to comparatively analyze the application of DE and CS models in simulating and optimizing student flow specifically within the Registrar’s Office setting \cite{Fonseca2023}. Our aim was to assess the strengths and limitations of each approach, identify bottlenecks, evaluate potential solutions, and ultimately improve the student experience. Recent studies have emphasized the importance of leveraging simulation modeling to enhance operational efficiency in higher education institutions. However, a comprehensive comparative analysis of DE and CS approaches, particularly in the context of the Registrar’s Office within a CSPC, remain limited. This research aimed to bridge this gap by providing a rigorous comparison of these two simulation techniques, offering practical guidance for administrators seeking to optimize student flow and enhance service delivery. By evaluating the effectiveness of DE and CS, the study will contributed for better understanding of how these methods can be applied to improve the overall educational experience in the context of a CSPC. 

\section{Statement of the Problem}

The Registrar’s Office faces operational inefficiencies in student flow management, which result in extended wait times and high congestion during busy times. The office faced challenges because it lacks dynamism and modeling tools that would simulate real-world registration scenarios to optimize service processes effectively. The combination of Discrete Event and Continuous Simulation models would allow for thorough student flow pattern analysis to reveal essential metrics about queue lengths and wait times and resource utilization, which would have helped identify operational bottlenecks and enhanced efficiency.The evaluation of these simulation models against key metrics such as average waiting time, queue length, service utilization, throughput, and overall system efficiency was necessary to determine the most effective approached for the Registrar’s Office. The comparison of these two simulation models would help decision-makers to select the appropriate model that balances accuracy and computational efficiency. This evaluation would support data-driven improvements in scheduling, staffing, and process design, ultimately enhancing student satisfaction and resource management.

Moreover, the creation of a 3D-based prototype system to visualize the student flow design transformed dry simulation data into an engaging and experiential journey for stakeholders. Visualization tools like these made it easier to communicate intricate operational scenarios more clearly, allowing administrators to explore spatial designs and test interventions virtually before actual implementation. By embedding simulation outputs within an interactive 3D environment, the Registrar’s Office enhanced decision-making, minimized implementation risks, and accelerated workflow execution, resulting in more effective and efficient student service delivery.

\section{Scope and Limitation}

This study was specifically centered on the Camarines Sur Polytechnic Colleges (CSPC), particularly its Registrar’s Office, where we addressed the CSPC administrators and students, and a comparative analysis of Discrete-event Smulation and Continuous Simulation models. Current student flow processes at CSPC Registrar’s Office were optimized to improve student flow, reduce waiting time, and enhance satisfaction by developing, validating, and comparing simulation models that used real-world data from the Registrar’s Office. The core objective was to determine which simulation approach—DES or CS—provides a more accurate, efficient, and practical solution for improved student flow and related administrative processes within the unique context of CSPC, ultimately aimed at streamlining operations and elevating service quality for both students and staff.

A critical limitation of this study is the reliance on data availability and the inherent variability of student behavior at CSPC. The accuracy and effectiveness of both Discrete-Event and Continuous Simulation models were highly dependent on the quality, completeness, and representative of the data collected from the Registrar’s Office. However, historical data might have been incomplete or failed to account for recent changes in student demographics, academic policies, or technological advancements, potentially limiting the models’ predictive power. Moreover, student behavior—such as arrival patterns, service requested, and processing times—is subject to significant variation due to factors like academic deadlines, personal circumstances, and evolving administrative procedures. This unpredictability introduces substantial uncertainty into the simulation results, making it challenging to fully capture the complexity and dynamism of real-world student flow. As such, while the models provided valuable insights for process optimization, their recommendations must be interpreted cautiously, with a clear understanding of the risks posed by data limitations and the inherent variability in student behavior.
